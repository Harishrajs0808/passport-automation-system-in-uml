# Passport Automation System (Object-Oriented Approach) 

# Objective: To streamline and automate the entire process of passport issuance through object-oriented design principles, ensuring better modularity, maintainability, and real-world mapping of system components.

# Key Functionalities:
1. User Registration & Login
2. Online Application Submission
3. Document Upload & Verification
4. Police Verification Process
5. Admin Review & Approval
6. Passport Issuance Notification

# Object-Oriented Design Elements
# 1. Class & Object
Each real-world entity in the system is represented as a class.
Examples:
1. Applicant – person applying for a passport
2. ApplicationForm – form filled by the applicant
3. Document – uploaded documents for verification
4. PoliceStation – conducts background verification
5. AdminOfficer – validates and approves the application
6. PassportOffice – overall system controller
Each class has attributes (data) and methods (operations).

# 2. Encapsulation
1. Keeps each class’s data private and secure.
2. Interaction is done through public methods.
Example: Applicant details are not directly accessible to other classes; they are accessed via getter methods.

# 3. Inheritance
Promotes code reuse.
Example: User is a base class. Applicant, AdminOfficer, and PoliceOfficer inherit from User and extend it with their specific responsibilities.

# 4. Polymorphism
Enables the same function name to behave differently for different classes.
Example: verify() method behaves differently in PoliceOfficer and AdminOfficer.

# 5. Abstraction
Shows only the necessary details to the user.
Internal processes like background checks, document validation are hidden.
